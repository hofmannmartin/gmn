This document describes the standard GMNTOOLS installation procedure on
Linux systems.


Required and optional software
------------------------------

The package requires version 2.7 or 3.x of Python, and is built from
source, so the header files and libraries for Python must be installed,
as well as the core binaries.

The installation requires the Python convex optimization package CVXOPT
as well as Numpy and Scipy.

The following software libraries are optional.

* DSDP5.8 <www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/DSDP> is a semidefinite programming solver.


Installation
------------

GMNTOOLS can be installed globally by writing:

    python setup.py install

It can also be installed locally by typing:

    python setup.py install --user

To test that the installation was successful, go to the test directory
and run the unit tests provided

     cd examples/test
     python test_gmn.py

If Python does not issue an error message, installation was successful.

Additional information can be found in the
Python documentation <http://docs.python.org/install/index.html>.
